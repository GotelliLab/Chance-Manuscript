This file contains the invitation text from Aaron Ellison and Michael Lavine to contribute an article to Chance. The contribution is due at the end of January 2016.

Dear friends and colleagues,

We (Aaron Ellison and Michael Lavine), are writing to ask whether you’d consider writing for CHANCE magazine.  CHANCE Is a peer-reviewed, non-technical statistics magazine highlighting applications that demonstrate sound statistical practice.  You can learn more about CHANCE at http://chance.amstat.org.

The two of us are soliciting articles for a special issue of CHANCE devoted to statistics in Ecology.  We’re looking for fun articles that use statistics or statistical graphics to say something about interesting ecological questions or issues in a way that can be explained at a low technical level without much mathematics.  Here’s an example of a recent article that was well-“liked”: http://chance.amstat.org/2014/09/streakiness/. Some of the others on CHANCE’s website are open access, and some are not.

We think you might be able to write a good article about one of the topics listed in the attachment. Note that the topics listed were our initial guesses and thoughts, but if you are interested in working with us on a paper for CHANCE, you should feel free to suggest alternative/better topics.
